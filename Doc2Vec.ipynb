      "i watched the pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is original. it is a word not used much in tv as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.the first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of jim dale. those not familiar with the british carry on ... series or those who have not listened to a harry potter book, may not be familiar with dale. i am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts. i will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a harry potter atmosphere. maybe that's a good thing.lee pace (infamous, the white countess) has a gift. it never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. he teams with chi mcbride (boston public, roll bounce) to solve murders using this talent. everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love, anna friel (goal! the dream begins, timeline) and things really get complicated. he can't send her back and he can never touch her. boy, would that make a relationship difficult.i will be tuning in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain.\n",
